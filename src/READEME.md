Game Instructions:
Use WASD to control the player
you can double jump by pressing double W while in the air
Press Q while on top of a powerup to pick it up
Using the Purple power up increases the height of your jumps
Using the Green power up enables you to press E and flip the gravity
The system displays your lives in the top left, hitting a mob repawns you and loses a life, falling off does not decrease your life but will respawn you.
If you get stuck at any point press r to get back to your spawnpoint.
Hitting a yellow cube saves that point as a checkpoint where you will respawn next time you die.
When you lose your lives you will restart with one less maximum health.
